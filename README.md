# Usage
A simple Windows Program meant to run as a service that will start shizuku when your device is plugged in.

# Notice
Currently only a couple Vendor ID's are apart of the devices file. You can mannually append the assets/devices post install or edit the file and compile the application yourself so it will support it natively. This project like many are just personal use projects uploaded for other people to enjoy.
